Media Manager
-----------------------

PHP app written by Kevin Koo Seng Kiat

- Used to upload images, videos, audio, PDF, etc.
- Previously part of SPBlog blogging app (also by Kevin Koo Seng Kiat)
- However, we are removing this and developing it as a separate app.


- Ideally, we can put this on a subdomain like https://cdn.domain.ext
- This means that this is a self-contained CDN manager

Next:
- Create a landing page to redirect to the actual blog.
